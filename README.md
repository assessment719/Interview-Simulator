<h1>This is a Interview Simulator</h1>

1. Front-End runs on http://localhost:5173
2. Back-End runs on http://localhost:3000
3. Server runs on http://localhost:2000

<b>Things Used To Make This:</b>
1. React
2. Node
3. Tailwind CSS
4. Typescript

<b>Obejective:</b> I want to make this like the students can prepare for Course Interveiews, Credibility Interveiews and Visa Interveiews on their own. The students will sign-up with their own credentials and after that giving a small payment they can evaluate their Interview preparation and improve if lagging.
